       <h2>Lorna Jane Mobile Application and Website Privacy Policy</h2>

        <h3>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h3>
        <p> Lorna Jane PTY LTD. (“Lorna Jane”) respects your privacy. We are particularly sensitive to privacy issues
            on the Internet and digital applications and therefore we provide this Privacy Policy so you know about our
            online information practices and understand how we treat the information we receive about you from the Internet
            and through our digital applications. </p>

        <h3>The Information We Collect</h3>
        <p> In general, you can use the application and other Lorna Jane owned digital properties without telling us who you
            are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We are, however, able to determine your IP address.
            We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our website, to measure the
            use of our website and to improve the content of our website. In short we use your IP to gather aggregate
            demographic information. </p>

        <p> There are a few places where we give you an opportunity to provide us your personal information. This refers
            to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities with the
            application, we may collect personal information to enhance the user experience. </p>

        <p> When you use the mobile application, we may collect your Name, Facebook ID, Date Of Birth, Gender, Weight, &amp;
            Height and other personal information. Providing this data is optional. </p>


        <h3>Sharing data</h3>

        <p> Users who accept the application via Facebook connect have the option to share their activity. These activities
            will post on the users Facebook Timeline with their name, their distance, their activity type &amp; duration/time.
            Connecting the application with Facebook is optional. </p>

        <h3>Activity data captured</h3>
        <p> When using the Lorna Jane mobile application we will record certain information about your Run Walk and Cycle
            activities performed. This information will be recorded from all application users not just Facebook connected
            users.  However Facebook connected users activities will be logged against their Facebook user ID &amp; name. </p>

        <h4>Activity data includes:</h4>
        <ul class="al">
            <li>Date of Activity: When the activity occurred</li>
            <li>Type of Activity: Walking, Running &amp; Cycling</li>
            <li>Total Activity Time: </li>
            <li>Distance Traveled</li>
            <li>Calories Burned</li>
            <li>Maximum Speed</li>
            <li>Average Speed</li>
            <li>Location Data related to these activities using GPS. </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Support the Cause</h4>

        <p> A user may also sign up to “Support The Cause” via the Lorna Jane sponsored sites
            <a href="http://www.nowmoveit.com" target="_blank">www.nowmoveit.com</a>  and
            <a href="http://www.nowmoveit.com.au" target="_blank">www.nowmoveit.com.au</a>.
            For the purposes of this initiative we will collect a users name, email address and mobile number.

            must agree to the terms of the privacy policy to continue. </p>


        <h3>Track the Movement</h3>
        <p> A map showing the location and type of application users’ activities (run/walk/cycle) will be displayed on
            <a href="http://www.nowmoveit.com/activity" target="_blank">http://nowmoveit.com/activity</a>. The mobile application connects
            with this website to display application users activities (run/walk/cycle) as noted above. Users are not required to provide
            their personal information on this website and can chose to provide their information as an anonymous user. </p>

        <p> If you choose to share any personal information with us, you will see that the amount and type of personal information we
            request depend on how you use the application. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect
            to engage in these activities, however, we may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name,
            mailing address (including postal code), email address, telephone and facsimile numbers, and other personal identifying information.
        </p>

        <p> Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary.
            If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.&nbsp;</p>

        <h3>The Way We Use Information</h3>

            providing you with the latest product and promotional information and other information that might be useful to you. We may
            use your personal information to deliver information to you and to contact you regarding administrative notices. We may share

            future communications. </p>

        <p> You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed, however, because we keep track of past transactions, you
            cannot delete information associated with past communications on our website. In addition, it may be impossible to completely delete
            your information without some residual information because of backups. </p>

        <p> We will encourage our service partners to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your personal information by our
            service partners is governed by the privacy policies of those service partners, and is not subject to our control. The Lorna Jane
            application may contain links to other non-Lorna Jane websites or digital properties. Lorna Jane is not responsible for the privacy
            practices or the content of such websites or digital properties and you should exercise your best judgment when sharing personal
            information on these websites or digital properties. </p>

        <h3> Our Commitment to Security of Your Personal Information </h3>
        <p> We want you to have continuing trust in Lorna Jane and in our products, applications and services and, so, we have put in place
            reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure your personal information. </p>

        <p> Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result,
            while we strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the
            Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between
            you and us through our website or digital applications cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed
            or tampered with in transit by a third party. </p>

        <h3>Children's Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p> The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect,
            use, and disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age, and that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians
            in order for children under 13 years of age to use certain features of our websites. &nbsp;Lorna Jane does not knowingly collect any
            information from children under the age of 13. </p>

        <p> We may amend our Children's Privacy Policy at any time. We will provide parents notice by email or posting on our website of any
            material changes in the way we intend to collect, use, and/or share a child's personal information. We will apply material changes
            in our Children's Privacy Policy only in conformance with applicable law, including any applicable provisions of COPPA that require
            parental consent. </p>

        <p> By using this application you are agreeing to the terms of the Lorna Jane Privacy Policy. &nbsp;We reserve the right to modify our
            privacy policy as business needs require. We will post such changes on our website. </p>
