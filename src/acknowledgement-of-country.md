stoqe is indie business made in Woiworung (aka Melbourne) and working on-site at Bargoonga Nganjin (aka: North Fitzroy Library). I acknowledge the Wurundjeri people as the traditional custodians of this country and and recognise their continuing connection to land, waters, and culture. I pay my respects to elders past, present, and emerging.

These lands never were and never will be ceeded: these are stolen lands.

*Bargoonga Nganjin means ‘Gather Everybody’ in Woiwurrung (the language of the Wurundjeri people) and is pronounced 'Bar-goon-ga Narn-yin'*
